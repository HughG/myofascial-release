I learned to use this self-massage technique  
to reduce or eliminate pain and discomfort  
from work and other sources  
and I hope you can, too.

???

Myofascial release, a.k.a. Trigger Point Therapy
is a simple and cheap massage technique
you can use for yourself
to help treat many kinds of chronic pain, discomfort, or restricted movement.

It's been really helpful for me
and I hope it can help some of you, too.

My experience is mostly based on

The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook 3rd Ed.  
by Clair Davies and Amber Davies  
published by [New Harbinger](https://www.newharbinger.com/9781608824946/the-trigger-point-therapy-workbook/), 19th Sep. 2013  
ISBN 9781608824946

(About Â£15 new, plus there's a free  
download summary of the diagrams.)

.right-column[

]

I've also had some physiotherapists  
use this technique.

???

The author worked as a piano tuner but became unable to work due to pain.

Through working with various physiotherapists he found that trigger-point therapy
was the only thing which worked for him.

He felt such benefit that he decided to re-train as a massage therapist
and wrote that book.

---

It's helped me with

* tingling/twitching leg & foot (sciatica-like)
* neck, shoulder, and head pain
* sudden mid-morning sleepiness
* disrupted sleep

---

**Sleepiness**

Sometimes I suddenly feel really sleepy mid-morning at work.

Massaging trigger points on or just above my eyebrow ridge  
often fixes that in under a minute!

Consult a medical professional first!

---

But maybe try this meanwhile or in parallel, in case of

* waiting time
* suggested treatment is
  * traumatic
  * expensive
  * only palliative

???

As the author points out, you should first consult a medical professional about chronic pain
but you may want to try self-treatment _as well_ if

* you face a long waiting time;
* the professionals suggest something intrusive, risky, and/or with side-effects;
* treatment or even consultation will be expensive; or
* the professionals have no suggestions other than painkillers.

Always apply common sense and go cautiously.

Traumatised muscles develop get stuck contracted in the middle  
and this can cause

* stiffness
* restricted movement
* pain
* other symptoms like tingling

???

The technique is based on the following model
which seems straightforward and anatomically plausible to me.

* Over-worked or otherwise traumatised muscles tend to develop residual "knots" of tension -- trigger points.
* These can restrict movement or, if they impinge on nerves, cause pain, tingling, or other discomfort.
* Because the brain's mapping from nerve signals to anatomy is imperfect,  
you may perceive "referred" pain at places other than the locations of these trigger points.
* Restricted movement and referred pain can lead you to compensate, causing a cascade of trigger points.

Luckily,
* the "knots" are basically always around the middle of muscle fibres; and
* the incorrect "knot to pain" mapping of the brain is basically the same for everyone; so
* it's possible to build a reverse lookup table: "if you feel sore here, try massaging there, there, or there".

---

Complicated because ...

* Some signals are mapped to the "wrong" anatomy  
giving "referred pain" elsewhere.
* Compensating for discomfort can set up a chain of trigger points.

Muscles have different strutures  
so the book has detailed instructions  
on how to find and massage each trigger point  
(without hurting yourself!).

---

The book often suggests  
what can create a specific trigger point  
so you can avoid it in future.

---

exclude: true

As well as the author's story and the principles of the model, the book has two main parts.

* Instructions on ways to self-massage various parts of the body without hurting yourself.
* Chapters for different areas of the body, each starting with a list mapping sub-areas to the muscles whose trigger points might affect those areas.

---

It's taken me time to apply this.

* Learning to notice discomfort and narrow it down.

* Find trigger points in specific muscles and learning how to massage them&mdash;damn you, sternocleidomastoid!

* Having patience over hours and days, while in pain.

* Doing it half-awake in the middle of the night!

* Different issues over time.
